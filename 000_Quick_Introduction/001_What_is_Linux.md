# What is Linux?

> [HOME](../README.md) --- [WHAT IS LINUX KERNEL](002_What_is_Linux_Kernel.md)

Strictly speaking, *Linux is not an Operating System*, instead ***Linux is a kernel.***

## Kernel
Kernel provides access to computer hardware & access control to resources.

* Describe who will use the resource, for how long and when.
* Linux kernel in itself is useless without other features.

***Linux Distribution = Kernel + GNU Application Utilities + GUI Apps + Utilities + Application Software + Software Development Tools + Linux Installation Scripts + Shell + Post Installation Management Tools***

## Who created Linux?

Linux Torvalds (in 1921) created Linux, when he was working with Minix (educational version of Unix).

Linux was a **kernel** developed by Linus.
